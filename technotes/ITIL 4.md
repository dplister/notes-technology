Framework for IT Service Management (ITSM).
__Service management__: A set of specialised organisational capabilities for enabling value to customers in the form of services.

_3rd Industrial Revolution_ (Electronic and IT systems, automation) -> ITIL was created.
ITIL = Information technology Infrastructure Library.

_4th Industrial Revolution 4IR_ (Cyber physical system): robotics, AI, IOT -> ITIL 4 for 4IR.
ITIL is no longer an acronym.

Walmart advantage is its service; providing customers the products they want at a low price. Enabled by distribution system (cost effectiveness, tracking).

Oriented around finding balance between speed and control.

__Governance__: the means by which an organisation is directed and controlled.

__Value__: the _perceived_ benefits, usefulness, and importance of something. Recipient determines the perceived value. Different recipients may value a part highly, and consider another part worthless.

ITIL 4 has two basic roles an organisation can fulfil: __service provider__ provides services to consumers, __consumer__ consumes those services. Value is co-created between the two roles; the value is the _outcome_.
Organisation can be both a supplier and a consumer simultaneously.

__User__ uses the service.
__Customer__ defines requirements for service and takes responsibility for the outcomes of service consumption.
__Sponsor__ authorises the budget for service consumption.
Can fulfil multiple roles simultaneously.
Usability, finances, requirements can fall out of alignment if roles don't coordinate.

__Service__ a means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.

A service provider cannot achieve outcomes for you.

__Product__: configuration of resources created by the organisation that will be potentially valuable for its customers.

A product combines and simplifies the various services.
Amazon Web Services EC2 + S3 + Route 53 (individual services) combined into Amazon LightSail (product).

__Service Offering__: a description of one or more services designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. Can include goods, access to resources, and service actions.
Parts of service offerings:
__Goods__: things that are transferred from the service provider to the consumer, and then the consumer is responsible for their future use; i.e. mobile phone received as part of a plan.
__Access to Resources__: access to resources are granted or licensed to a consumer under agreed terms and conditions; i.e. Udemy course.
__Service Action__: actions performed to address a consumer's needs; i.e. technical support.

__Service Relationship__: a cooperation between a service provider and service consumer including service provision, service consumption, and service relationship management.
When two orgs want to work together they form a relationship. 
__Service Provision__: activities performed by an organisation to provide the services.
__Service Consumption__: activities performed by an organisation to consume the services; paying bill, checking email, making calls on phone.
__Service Relationship Management__: activities that the service provider and the service consumer do together to enable value co-creation to occur based upon the service offerings; consumer paying their bill on time, service provider communicating - notifying of server downtime.

__Outcome__ a result for a stakeholder, enabled by one or more outputs.
Balancing risk and costs. Services may impose certain costs and risks. Have to remove more costs and risks than imposing.
If value is being co-created to achieve the supported outcomes, then the removal of the costs and the removal of risk has to be greater than the unintended consequences.
Value propositions change when the factors change.

__Costs__ amount of money / person hours / FTEs spent on a specific activity or resource.
__Risks__ possible event that could cause harm, loss, or make it more difficult to achieve objectives.
As a consumer:
1. Defines the requirements of the service and clarify the required outcomes.
2. Clearly communicate any constraints and the critical success factors.
3. Must ensure providers have access to the necessary resources.

Service provider options:
- Risk avoidance involves removing risks from the service.
- Risk acceptance is used when the risk or cost is considered low.
- Risk transfer is often used when you insure against a risk.
- Risk mitigation is used when you implement technology or processes to reduce the risk.

A service should have both utility and warranty.
__Utility__: functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need. "What it does" Fit for purpose. Requires that a service support the performance or remove constraints from the consumer. Social media: sharing posts.
__Warranty__: assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements. "How it does it" Fit for use. Requires that a service has defined and agreed-upon conditions that are met. Social media: site is always accessible. Concerned with availability, capacity, capability, security requirements.

__Four Dimensions of Service Management__
1. Organisations & People
	How do we organise our teams?
	Education / skills / experience.
	Outsourced expertise.
2. Information & Technology
	Collecting data.
	Tooling.
3. Partners & Suppliers
	 External teams that are going to contribute to the success of our service.
	 How do we communicate with partners / suppliers?
	 How do we receive communication back?
4. Value Streams & Processes
	 Identifying and eliminating waste.
	 Identifying value stream steps that are non value-adding activities and removing them.

__Service Value System (SVS)__ describes how all the components and activities of the work organisation work together as a system to enable value co-creation.
Require integration and coordination of activities, practices, teams, authorities, responsibilities.
Ensures co-creation of value.

Input: Opportunity / demand
Output: Value
Process Layers: Guiding Principles / Continual Improvement -> Governance / Practices -> Service Value Chain

__Guiding Principle__ a recommendation that guides an organisation in all circumstances.
Allows organisation to integrate them into an overall approach to service management.
Encourage and support organisations in continual improvement.

1) Focus on Value; all stakeholders, service provider, customer.
2) Start where you are.
3) Progress iteratively with feedback.
4) Collaborate and promote visibility.
5) Think and work holistically.
6) Keep it simple and practical.
7) Optimise and automate.

__Service Value Chain__
Not linear:
Plan & Improve encapsulate other steps.
Engage -> (Obtain/build + Design & Transition + Deliver & Support) -> Products and Services

Service value chain uses interactions between practices.
Each activity contributes to the service value chain by transforming specific inputs into outputs.
Service value chain activities use different combinations of the 34 ITIL practices.

All incoming and outgoing interactions are performed through the engage activity.
All new resources are obtains through the obtain/build activity.
Planning at all levels is performed by plan.
Improvements at all levels are initiated and managed through the improve activity. 

__Continual Improvement__
Aligns the organisation's practices and services with changing business needs through the ongoing identification and improvement of services, service components, practices, or any element involved in the efficient and effective management of products and services.

What is the vision? 
-> Where are we now? 
-> Where do we want to be? 
-> How do we get there?
-> Take Action 
-> Did we get there? 
-> (Return to beginning) How do we keep the momentum going?

__Practice__ a set of organised resources designed for performing work or accomplishing an objective.
